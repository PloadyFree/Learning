Convert time to string

SELECT CONVERT(CHAR(5), date, 110) "mm-dd" 
FROM Battles;

Same could be done using MONTH() and DAY()
SELECT date 
FROM Battles 
ORDER BY MONTH(date), DAY(date);

Add a name
SELECT DAY(date) BD_day, DATENAME(mm, date) BD_month, name 
FROM Battles 
ORDER BY MONTH(date), DAY(date);
