Using aliases

SELECT
	cust_name,
	cust_contact
FROM
	Customers AS C,
	Orders AS O,
	OrderItems AS OI
WHERE
	C.cust_id = O.cust_id
AND OI.order_num = O.order_num
AND prod_id = 'RGAN01'

---

SELF JOIN

SELECT
	*
FROM
	Customers AS C1,
	Customers AS C2
WHERE
	C2.cust_contact = 'Jim Jones'
AND C1.cust_name = C2.cust_name

---

(NATURAL?) JOIN

SELECT
	C.*, O.order_num,
	O.order_date,
	OI.prod_id,
	OI.quantity,
	OI.item_price
FROM
	Customers AS C,
	Orders AS O,
	OrderItems AS OI
WHERE
	C.cust_id = O.cust_id
AND OI.order_num = O.order_num
AND prod_id = 'RGAN01'

OUTER JOIN (same as inner, but includes also NULL when there are no coincedences)

SELECT
	Customers.cust_id,
	Orders.order_num
FROM
	Customers
LEFT OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.cust_id = Orders.cust_id

right or left means whih rows should be included

FULL OUTER JOIN includes everything

Using with resulting functions

SELECT
	Customers.cust_id,
	count(Orders.order_num)
FROM
	Customers
LEFT OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.cust_id = Orders.cust_id
GROUP BY
	Customers.cust_id
