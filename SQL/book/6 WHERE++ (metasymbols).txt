LIKE

---

% - LIKE '*' in regular expressions (sometimes it is '*', not '%')

SELECT prod_id, prod_name
FROM Products
WHERE prod_name LIKE 'Fish%'

SELECT prod_id, prod_name
From Products
WHERE prod_name LIKE '%bean bag%'

Sometimes empty space in string fills by whitespaces, so these patterns may not work
Also '%' doesn't correspond to NULL values

---

_ - Like '?' in regular expressions (exactly one symbol)

SELECT prod_id, prod_name
FROM Products
WHERE prod_name LIKE '__ inch teddy bear'

---

[] - Like same in regular expressions (group of symbols)

Example below returns all customers whose contact begins with J or M
SELECT cust_contact
FROM Customers
WHERE cust_contact LIKE '[JM]%'
ORDER BY cust_contact

LIKE '[^JM]%' --begins with anything excluding J and M (Sometimes it's '!', not '^')

Same thing
SELECT cust_contact
FROM Customers
WHERE NOT cust_id LIKE '[JM]%'
ORDER BY cust_contact
