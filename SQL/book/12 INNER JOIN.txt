INNER JOIN

Get all products by vendor
Count of rows will be size(Vendors) * size(Products)

SELECT vend_name, prod_name, prod_price
FROM Vendors, Products
WHERE Vendors.vend_id = Products.vend_id

The same
SELECT vend_name, prod_name, prod_price
FROM Vendors INNER JOIN Products ON Vendors.vend_id = Products.vend_id


SELECT prod_name, vend_name, prod_price, quantity
FROM OrderItems, Products, Vendors
WHERE	Products.vend_id = Vendors.vend_id
	AND	OrderItems.prod_id = Products.prod_id
	AND	order_num = 20007
	

Same as in 11th lesson
SELECT DISTINCT
	Customers.cust_name
FROM
	Customers,
	Orders,
	OrderItems
WHERE
	Customers.cust_id = Orders.cust_id
AND OrderItems.order_num = Orders.order_num
AND OrderItems.prod_id = 'RGAN01'
