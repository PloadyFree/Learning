Why to use table name?

SELECT AVG(price)
FROM (
SELECT price, maker
FROM Product INNER JOIN PC ON Product.model = PC.model
UNION
SELECT price, maker
FROM Product INNER JOIN Laptop ON Product.model = Laptop.model
) as TableName
WHERE maker = 'A'

---

How does it work?

SELECT model FROM PC
GROUP BY model
ORDER BY MAX(price) DESC;

and it doesn't

SELECT model FROM PC
GROUP BY model
ORDER BY price DESC;

Ans: It sorts whole groups
